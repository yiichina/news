Since we posted the recruitment notice, we have received many applications for joining the Yii developer team. We hereby thank you all for your passion to join the team!

After serious discussion and investigation, we chose to have three new members: [jonah, pestaa, sebas](http://www.yiiframework.com/about). They will work on the official extension library, core framework development, documentation and site development. With these new forces, we believe Yii will grow even faster and become better and better.

Welcome, new team members!
