It's official now: Yii is on [GitHub](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii)! We also switched to use [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii/issues). Existing issues have already been imported into it.

Many users have requested for this, and we think it's a wise move to put Yii on GitHub to encourage more people to participate in developing Yii.

SVN users, do not worry. We will still keep [our SVN repository](http://code.google.com/p/yii/source/checkout). A synchronization between our git repository and svn repository will be done nightly.

如果你遇到任何问题，请告诉我们。感谢您的支持！
