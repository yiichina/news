We are proud to announce the release of Yii Framework v1.0.8!

In this release, we fixed about a dozen of bugs and included more than twenty minor feature enhancements. We refactored the yiic shell commands so that they are easier to be extended. We enhanced caching components to support multiget. We also improved CCaptcha, CCompareValidator, CActiveRecord in several aspects. For a list of all enhancements and issues resolved in this release, please see [change logs](http://www.yiiframework.com/files/CHANGELOG-1.0.8.txt).

Upgrading to v1.0.8 should be safe except that you should pay attention to the change in the order of path alias importing. In particular, starting from v1.0.8, a directory imported using Yii::import() will have precedence over any existing include paths. For example, if we import 'application.models.*', then the corresponding directory will be searched before any other existing include paths. This also means, a directory imported later will have precedence over directories imported earlier. Previously, this order was reversed. This change may affect you if you have several classes with the same name and they are imported via different directories. You will need to adjust the import order of these directories to make sure your existing applications are not broken due to this change.
