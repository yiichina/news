Today we've released version 2.1.1 of the Twig extension. Changes are the following:

Exception page now displays exact template line where an issue has occurred. Before there was, at best, a line from template compiling result that was not useful at all.
A Twig extension added allowing to work with Html helper in templates. You can find more details in the guide. Without the extension it was not possible to use methods such as addCssClass() because of Twig limitations.
Bugfixes.
More docs.
This version was worked on by new Twig extension maintainer, Anton Gubarev (@amarox). He's using the extension is his projects and volunteered to both polish it to perfection and develop it further.
