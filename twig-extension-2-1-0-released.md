We are very pleased to announce the release of [Twig extension](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-twig) version 2.1.0. This version is not fully backwards compatible with 2.0.6. It adds support for scalar global variables, unifies path() and url() syntax to match Url::to() and makes package more flexible by using DI container to instantiating extensions.

Thanks to everyone contributed to this release.

See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-twig/blob/2.1.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
