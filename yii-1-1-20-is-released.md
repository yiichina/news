We are very pleased to announce that Yii Framework version 1.1.20 is released. You can download it at [yiiframework.com/download/](https://www.yiiframework.com/download/#yii1).

This release is a release of Yii 1.1 that [has reached maintenance mode](https://www.yiiframework.com/news/90/update-on-yii-1-1-support-and-end-of-life/) and will, only receive necessary security fixes and fixes to adjust the code for compatibility with PHP 7 if they do not cause breaking changes. This allows you to keep your servers PHP version up to date in the environments where old Yii 1.1 applications are hosted and stay within the [version ranges supported by the PHP team](http://php.net/supported-versions.php). Yii 1.1.20 is compatible with PHP 7.2 that, at the time of this writing, has an announced security support until November 30, 2020.

We recommend to use Yii 2.0 for new projects as well as introducing Yii 2.0 for developing new features in existing Yii 1.1 apps, as described in [the Yii 2 guide](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-tutorial-yii-integration.html#using-both-yii2-yii1). Upgrading a whole app to Yii 2.0 will, in most cases, result in a total rewrite so this option provides a way for upgrading step by step and allows you to keep old applications up to date even with low budget.

This release includes a few PHP 7 compatibility fixes and security improvements.

For the complete list of changes in this release, please see [the change log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiisoft/yii/1.1.20/CHANGELOG). For upgrading, always make sure to read the [upgrade instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiisoft/yii/1.1.20/UPGRADE), however in this release there are no changes that require changes.

We would like to express our gratitude to [all contributors](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii/graphs/contributors) who have spent their precious time helping improve Yii and made this release possible.
