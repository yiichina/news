We are proud to announce the release of Yii Framework v1.0.6!

In this release, we included more than twenty feature enhancements and about ten bug fixes. Some of the major feature enhancements are summarized as follows.

We improved the yiic shell command so that it can generate model classes all at once for the tables in a database. In addition, the command also generates the relations it discovers in the tables. We enhanced the logging feature in several aspects, including logging context information and profiling of SQL executions. We implemented the support for using a controller action to display application errors. Last but not the least, we added CFileCache which allows to cache data in files.
