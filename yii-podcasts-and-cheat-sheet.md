Our community member Imre Mehesz just released the episode 4 of his Yii Radio Podcast series. These casts cover the hot topics and recent activities about the Yii framework. You may check it out at [yiiradiio.mehesz.net](http://yiiradiio.mehesz.net/).

Another community member Sebasti√°n Thierer is kindly enough to create and share this convenient [Yii cheat sheet](http://www.yiiframework.com/files/yii-1.0-cheatsheet.pdf) for every Yii user.

Thank you all for your continuous support and contribution to Yii!
